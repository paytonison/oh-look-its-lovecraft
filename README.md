## Summary
The story takes place in the gothic-fantasy world of Azoth, where vivid dreams and nightmares can manifest into reality as monstrous entities called nihil. These nightmares are remnants of a cosmic curse left by a fallen god known as *He Who Sleeps Beneath*. In response to this threat, an organization called the S.L.E. (Supernatural Law Enforcement) was formed to contain and destroy nihil and investigate any signs of false gods, corruption, or supernatural events. The narrative is set in the year 1890 in a world where steampunk, eldritch horror, and imperial politics collide.

The story follows two main characters: Harper James, a young coroner for the Kilthorne S.L.E. struggling to earn respect beyond the shadow of his family legacy, and Alliaster Gallagher, an antihero operating under the alias “Captain Blackstock,” who’s working to undermine the corrupt upper ranks of the S.L.E. The two men are on parallel paths: Harper investigates the surge of nihil and a cold case that hints at deeper corruption, while Alliaster is driven by revenge and personal loss after his nephew is captured for potentially dreaming.

The plot begins with a dramatic heist in a religious stronghold, where Alliaster and his crew break in and escape through a planned explosion. Meanwhile, Harper defies orders to explore forbidden catacombs beneath the city, encountering a nihil which he manages to kill using a specialized weapon and a prosthetic arm treated with dream-substance, Elysium. He is caught and reprimanded by Commander Nieven but is soon assigned to a new cadaver case that may connect to a broader conspiracy.

Throughout the early chapters, the story alternates between Harper’s procedural investigations and Alliaster’s rogue operations. The setting is rich with imagined history, religion, and political tension—particularly surrounding the use and suppression of dreams. Side characters include Harper’s sarcastic vampire valet Cain, Alliaster’s masked lieutenant Simon, and his wide-eyed nephew Demonte, each contributing to the world’s atmosphere and lore.

As the two men pursue their separate goals—Harper toward truth and recognition, Alliaster toward rebellion and justice—their paths are set to converge against a backdrop of dream-born horrors, crumbling institutions, and a reawakening god.
